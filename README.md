New York Community Network

This network is volunteered, built by NYU-Poly Computer Science students. Currently the team consists one formal member for overall development, implementation and in-time updates. The original idea of this network is based on builder's real life experience in NYU-Poly. Meanwhile, after observing and researching a lot among other Polyers, this work has eventually been invented. Great thanks for earlier effort by Ethan Wang, Tian Liang and others as well. Without your inspirations and hard working, the site would not go this far.

Short writing to new people,

Under the thunder and storm, there is a place like home that keeps us warm and cool. Before coming to university study in United States, many of us, with a simple American dream shaped in our minds.The unknown tomorrow, full of doubtness, thorns, estranged environments with a whole lost, all putting together baffled our march again and again. We stay alert, know that we are young, and we keep replenishing ourselves, do what we can. Those different desires in our studies, work, lives combined with all tricky situations had determined us a disparate one. We sometimes may have been deviated. Today, standing at the point, just keep rocking to summit, cause this time would be more enjoyable and expecting. Rockinus dedicates your study and social life in many aspects, boosting your life as much as it could.
We look forward to see your days turning great, being considered more carefully, and that is exactly why we are here. As said, you only live once, but if you do it right, once is enough. Do, rock in U.S.
